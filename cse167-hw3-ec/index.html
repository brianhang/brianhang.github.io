                First, open the project and compile with Visual Studio. Once the
                program is running, two windows will open. The first window is
                the original window from HW3. The second window is the <em>render window</em>,
                which shows the 3D model. Note that is has a blue background for distinction.
            </p>
            <figure></figure>
            <p>
                The two windows have separate controls.
                The curve editor window mostly has the same keyboard controls.
                There is one new keyboard control: pressing <kbd>R</kbd> key will take
                the current curve and render it as a 3D model in the render window.
            </p>
            <figure></figure>
            <p>
                The first time you do this, you will notice that the model appears to be dark. This is because the
                scene by default has no lights. Focus on the render window by clicking on it. Lights can be added by pressing the
                <kbd>L</kbd> key. A light will be added to where the camera currently is.
            </p>
            <figure></figure>
            <p>
                The camera can be moved around the object by pressing and holding the <img src="assets/images/mouse-left-click.png" class="mouse-btn" /> left mouse button. Moving the mouse will then rotate
                the camera around the object. The camera can be zoomed in and out by pressing and holding the <img src="assets/images/mouse-right-click.png" class="mouse-btn" /> right mouse button.
                Moving the mouse up will zoom in, and moving the mouse down will zoom out.
            </p>
            <figure></figure>
            <p>
                To reset the camera view, press the <kbd>R</kbd> key in the render window.
            </p>

                    Putting these controls together:

                </video>
            </figure>
            <p>
                To close the program, press the <kbd>Q</kbd> key from either window.

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>
            First, I used glut to create a second window in <code>main.cpp</code>. So now, when the program opened, a second window would open.
            Then, callbacks were needed to make the window actually show stuff. So, in spirit of the <code>Scene</code> class from HW3, I created
            another class called <code>RenderScene</code>. I added callbacks for the display, reshape, and keyboard functions so the window would show a blue image
            and pressing <kbd>Q</kbd> would close the program. Since I will need to show a 3D model later on, I began recreating parts of HW2:
            <ol>
                <li>Added light shaders from HW2</li>
                <li>Created an <code>initShader</code> method for <code>RenderScene</code> and called it in <code>main</code> to load the light shaders</li>
                <li>Added a camera with the appropriate projection and modelview matrices using <code>glm</code></li>
                <li>Created a <code>RevolutionSurface</code> class which for now just drew a cube</li>
            </ol>
            So, the second window would just draw a lit cube. The next step was to set up camera controls. I added the mouse and motion callback functions 
            to rotate and move the camera about the origin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, the actual curve needed to be created. The main idea was to create a parametrized surface by taking a position <code>(x,y)</code> from the 2D curve
                and mapping it to points <code>(x * cos(&theta;), y, x * sin(&theta;))</code> where &theta; would range from 0 to 2&pi;. This required modification of the <code>Curve</code> class
                to store the interpolated points since the class only stored the control points. So, a quick hack was done to have the <code>draw</code> method for the curves just store the interpolated points.
            <p>
                With access to the interpolated points, I could now actually set up vertices for the surface of revolution.
                I added some code to the <code>RevolutionSurface</code> class to create vertices using the formula above.
                Triangles were created from these vertices. For a fixed vertex, the vertex to the right and the vertices below the two
                gave a quadrilateral. This quadrilateral could then be divided into two triangles.
                To compute the normal vector for the surface, the cross product of the side vectors for triangles were used.
                Then, the appropriate OpenGL buffers (VBO, EBO, NBO) and the VAO were setup using the points. Finally, the
                surface could be drawn.
