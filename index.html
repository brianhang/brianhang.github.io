                <p>
                    My name is Brian and I am passionate about Computer Science.
                    I became interested in Computer Science at the age of twelve
                    when I discovered the <a href="https://www.lua.org/home.html">Lua</a>
                    programming language and was able to turn my imagination
                    into creations using code. Since then, my desire to create more
                    and to learn more about the field grew.
                <p>
                    Currently, I am a second-year student studying Mathematics -
                    Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego.
                    Furthermore, I am seeking internship offers for Spring
                    and/or Summer 2017 to gain more experience in the field.
                </p>

                        <p>
                            TritonScheduler is a tool written in Python for creating optimal schedules for students.
                            The tool takes in a list of desired classes, then finds all the sections for those classes
                            by scraping the UCSD Schedule of Classes. A genetic algorithm is then used to find an optimal
                            schedule using a fitness function that considers the number of classes per day, the length of gaps between
                            classes, and more.

                        <p>
                            This project is a CHIP-8 interpreter written in Lua. The interpreter is enclosed
                            in an object for easy embedding in other Lua applications. The project comes with
                            an example that uses the interpreter and <a href="https://love2d.org/">Love2D</a>
                            to play games.

                        <p>
                            ImageFabric is a program created with SFML and C++ that takes in an image and
                            creates a fabric using the image. The fabric is simulated using Verlet integration.
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuc_SZpLlL8">Here</a> is a video demonstration.

                            JustinTime is a work-in-progress 2D game created with SFML and C++. The game features
                            several minigames that emulates the life of a generic college student.
