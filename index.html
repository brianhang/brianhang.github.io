                <p>
                    My name is Brian and I am passionate about Computer Science.
                    I became interested in Computer Science at the age of twelve
                    when I discovered the <a href="https://www.lua.org/home.html">Lua</a>
                    programming language and was able to turn my imagination
                    into creations using code. Since then, my desire to create more
                    and to learn more about the field grew.
                <p>
                    Currently, I am a second-year student studying Mathematics -
                    Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego.
                    Furthermore, I am seeking internship offers for Spring
                    and/or Summer 2017 to gain more experience in the field.
                </p>

                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
                industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
                text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
                of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
                popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
                Lorem Ipsum.
